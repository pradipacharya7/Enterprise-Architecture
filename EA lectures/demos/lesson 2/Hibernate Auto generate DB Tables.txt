When configuring Hibernate Session OR EntityManager[JPA], there is a DEVELOPMENT time
convenience function to AUTO generate the DB tables from the Domain Classes.
Here is an example:
            <prop key="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto">create-drop</prop>
  The functon is intended to be a developer tool and not to facilitate any production level databases 
 
 Here are the possible options:

    validate: validate the schema, makes no changes to the database.
    update: update the schema.
    create: creates the schema, destroying previous data.
    create-drop: drop the schema at the end of the session.
